# BadoToreninngu

This is an attempt at a badminton training website. The main feature I want to have working is a footwork shadow randomiser. which will gameify training footwork for badminton.

An additional feature will be a badminton "whiteboard" allowing the user to easily show some formations to help in explaining some badminton theory and tactics.



The Player Formations page is the first to open

Then the Reaction Game can be started with a button, allowing the user to begin the session.
